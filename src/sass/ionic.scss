// class to dynamically hide the ion-nav-bar for v1 Amazon flow
ion-nav-bar.hide { display: block !important; }

// the ion tabs element never needs it's own background (backgrounds are
// rendered by the tabs), and the default background would cover the scanner
ion-tabs.ion-tabs-transparent {
  background: none transparent;
}

// Some overrides for the card class which can't be set by variable
.card, .list {
  .icon {
    color: $light-gray;
  }
  & > .item-heading {
    font-weight: 700;
    .icon {
      color: $mid-gray;
    }
  }
}
