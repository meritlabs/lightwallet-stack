    into Merit World. Don't worry we will try you choose way to enter into Merit World =)</p>
    <h2>MERIT IS AN INVITE-ONLY NETWORK, AND YOU MUST BE INVITED IN ORDER TO JOIN.</h2>
    <p>Merit is in this for the long-term, and having a strong community is very
      important to us. We believe in a controlled-growth model that allows the network
      to grow safely and effectively. Further, the Ambassador-mining mining and our
      burn-proof sending both rely on the invitation functionality of Merit. To
      learn more, you can read about our thinking behind controlled-growth and
      how ambassador mining works.</p>
    <h2>WAYS TO GET AN INVITE</h2>
    <h3>ASK PEOPLE YOU KNOW</h3>
    <p>The first, and perhaps most effective, way to obtain an invite is to check
      with the people you know first. A good first port of call are the people
      you know who are already enthusiastic and knowledgable.</p>
    <h3>TRY YOUR EXTENDED NETWORK</h3>
    <p>If no one comes to mind in your immediate network, you might try to reaching
      out to your broader network. Social networks such as Twitter and Facebook might
      be effective. Also, professional networks like LinkedIn could be strong candidates.</p>
    <h3>ENGAGE IN THE MERIT COMMUNITY</h3>
    <p>A great place to find someone inside the Merit network already is the Merit community.
      Merit is present in a large number of places, from Slack to our very own forum.</p>
