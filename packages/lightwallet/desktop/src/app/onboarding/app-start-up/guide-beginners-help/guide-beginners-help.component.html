    <h2>Hey there!</h2>
    <p>It looks like you are new to the Merit world, and do not yet know anyone in the community who can invite you. Don't worry
      -- we'll help you learn a little bit more about the Merit ecosystem, and help you on your way toward joining the network.</p>
    <h2>MERIT IS A COMMUNITY. YOU NEED AN INVITATION TO JOIN.</h2>
    <p>Merit aims to build a digital currency that endures. An invite-only ecosystem makes the network safer and stronger. Some
      Merit features, such as ambassador mining and indestructable sending, are built atop the invite-only system. To learn
      more, you can read about our thinking behind

    <h2>3 WAYS TO GET AN INVITE</h2>
    <h3>ASK PEOPLE YOU KNOW</h3>
    <p>The first, and perhaps most effective, way to obtain an invite is to check with the people you know first. A good first
      port of call are the people you know who are already enthusiastic and knowledgeable.</p>
    <h3>TRY YOUR EXTENDED NETWORK</h3>
    <p>If no one comes to mind in your immediate network, you might try to reaching out to your broader network. Social networks
      such as Twitter and Facebook might be effective. Also, professional networks like LinkedIn could be strong candidates.</p>
    <h3>ENGAGE IN THE MERIT COMMUNITY</h3>
    <p>A great place to find someone inside the Merit network already is the Merit community. Merit is present in a lot of the
      largest communities on the web, from Slack and Discord to our to our very own forum.</p>
