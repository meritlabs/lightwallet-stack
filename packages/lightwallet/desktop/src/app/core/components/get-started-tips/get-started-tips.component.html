            <a href="https://www.merit.me/get-started/#get-merit-desktop" target="blank">downloading the Merit
              wallet</a> and importing your wallet using your 12-word passphrase. You can read more about how to

          </li>
          <li>
            Because there are many security miners in the Merit community, most users will want to join a mining pool.
            Merit offers a free
            <a href="https://pool.merit.me/" target="blank">zero-fee pool</a> that allows you to mine along with other
            members of the community, increasing your chances of winning security rewards.
