        <p>When you bring an active new member into the Merit community, your
          <strong>growth score</strong> will increase. There is a growth lottery every minute, and a higher score earns you a higher
          chance to win. To grow your community, you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tell your friends your share code:
            <button class="ui-button ui-button--xs ui-button--blue">share now</button>
          </li>
          <li>
            Share a summary of Merit with friends!

          How do I get Growth Rewards?
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The best way to win Growth Mining Rewards is to increase your growth score. You can do this by sending your invite
            tokens to friends, family or colleagues that would be a good addition to the Merit community. </li>
          <li>Growth Mining is not just about the number of people you invite; it's also about how active those people are. Keep
            this in mind as you use your limited number of invites.</li>

            Because there are many security miners in the Merit community, most users will want to join a mining pool. Merit offers a
            free
            <a href="https://pool.merit.me/" target="blank">zero-fee pool</a> that allows you to mine along with other members of the community, increasing your chances
            of winning security rewards.
