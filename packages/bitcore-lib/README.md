Bitcore Library
=======

A pure and powerful JavaScript Merit library.

## Principles

Merit is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Merit network allows for highly resilient Merit infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement Merit apps and services.

To get community assistance and ask for help with implementation questions, please use our [community forums](https://forum.merit.me/), [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/X3v3n3b), or [Telegram](https://t.me/meritocracy).


## Security

We're using Bitcore in production, but please use common sense when doing anything related to finances! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions.

If you find a security issue, please email security@bitpay.com.
